Space Battle Saga: A 2D Multiplayer Shooting Game

Project Overview

Project Title & Description

Space Battle Saga is a 2D shooting game developed using Python and Pygame. The game allows players to control spaceships in either Single Player mode (vs AI) or Dual Player mode (local multiplayer). Players aim to shoot down their opponent while managing movement, bullets, and health. The project demonstrates game mechanics, graphics handling, sound integration, and user interaction through a fun and engaging space battle.

Objectives

•	To design and implement a 2D shooting game using Python and Pygame.
•	To provide single-player mode with AI and dual-player mode for interactive gameplay.
•	To integrate graphics, animations, and sound effects for an enhanced user experience.
•	To apply principles of game mechanics, collision detection, and health tracking.

Technology Stack

•	Programming Language: Python 3  
•	Game Development Library: Pygame  
•	Graphics & Animations: Pillow (PIL), custom assets (PNG, JPG, GIF)  
•	Audio Processing: Pygame Mixer (MP3, WAV support)  
•	Version Control & Collaboration: Git, GitHub  
•	UI/UX Design Tools: Photoshop / Canva (for asset design)  
•	Project Management: Agile methodology with GitHub issue tracking & pull requests  
•	Platform: Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS)
